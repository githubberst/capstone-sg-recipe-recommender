    "Comparing the recommendations from Jaccard and Cosine similarity approaches, it seems that Jaccard is more intuitive to understand based on its score as equal weight is given to matches and non-matches, which is the project's intent. On the contrary, Cosine similarity scoring can be hard to comprehend since it takes into account the commonness/rarity per ingredient, which does not really account for much business use here, i.e. if a user only has rice and doesn't have noodles at home, it really doesn't make much sense to suggest a recipe that uses noodles just because noodles are similar to rice in terms of it being a source of carb.
